# Problem Solving

****Question 1: Array Reversal
Write a JavaScript function to reverse an array without using the built-in `reverse()` method. Explain the time complexity of your solution.
Code file : array.js

****Question 2: Find the Maximum
Given an array of numbers, write a JavaScript function to find the maximum value in the array. Explain whether your solution has a linear or constant time complexity.
Code file : max.js


**Question 3: Palindrome Check**
Create a JavaScript function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Describe how you would optimize this function to reduce time complexity.
Code file : palindrome.js
